# navigate

This is a Flutter app that demonstrates how to:

1. Use a Bottom Nav bar
2. Set up Provider v6 to control data, including the desired route

This is based on a [Youtube video by Learn Flutter With
Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oskdrY1shV0). (Thanks, LFWM guy!)

It was made before Flutter 3 was a thing, so there is one minor difference that
I call out in `main.dart`.

There is also a newer package, `go_router` that is based on these same ideas,
but streamlines things a bit more. I'm leaving this here as a worked example of
"Navigation 2".
